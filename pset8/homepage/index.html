    <h1>Why We Use Different Number Systems </h1>
    <p> Number systems are pervasively used in computing to represent numbers. This
    is because computers at a base level only understand numbers. All numbers,
    letters, images, and other representations are translated into defined number
    systems in the computer system architecture. </p><p>The value of each digit in a number
    is based on the digit, the position of the digit in the number and the base system
    used for the number. Since different number systems are used in different
    computing applications and architecture, being able to convert between different
    number systems are critical. </p>
    <p>The key number systems to know are:</p>
    <ol> <li>Binary number system – Also referred to as base 2, as it uses two
    distinct digits (0, 1) to represent all values. Binary is pervasively
    used in computing – all computer languages and programming at its
    lowest level, encodes all values to binary.</li>
    <li>Octal number system – Also referred to as base 8, as it uses eight
    distinct digits (0, 1, …, 6, 7) to represent all values. Octal was
    widely used in computing when 26 and 36 bit CPUs were common.
    Its use continues in Unix file system management, but in broader
    computing, it has declined in favour of the hexadecimal number
    system.</li><li>
    Decimal number system – Also referred to as base 10, as it uses
    ten distinct digits (0, 1, …, 8, 9). This is used for currency/money
    and is typically used in much of the world for endless operations.</li><li>
    Hexadecimal number system - Also referred to as base 16, as it
    uses 16 distinct alphanumeric values (0, 1, …, 8, 9, A, B, …, E, F).
    Base 16 is widely used in computing. Some example are - to define
    locations in memory, defining colours on web pages – each colour
    is represented by two hexadecimal values for red, blue, green
    concentration required.</li></ol><p>Below you can see the same numeric value represented in different bases.</p>
